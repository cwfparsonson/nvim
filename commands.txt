ctrl+w o (close all buffers except current)
:resize 10 (set split to 10 rows tall)
:vertical resize 20 (set split to 20 columns wide)

Tip: File tree can be helpful for ramping up on a new project but less helpful once you know where you want to go
Tip: ThePrimeagen uses splits not tabs, and tends not to have splits open for very long

# Fuzzy finder (fzf)
ctrl+p (open fuzzy finder)
ctrl+t (open result in new tab)
ctrl+^ (switch between last 2 files opened with fzf)
Tip: Have a main file that serves as hub, <Ctrl + p> to file you want to go to (spoke), and then <Ctrl + ^> back to hub (avoid hopping around in a triangle between more than 2 files)

# GIT
------------------------------------------------------
# basic
git add -u . (remove deleted files from github. Can then commit+push)
git remote -v (list remote origin)

# force pull
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull origin master

# force push
git push <remote_url> --force

# change remote origin
git remote rm origin (remove origins)
git remote add origin <remote_url>
git config master.remote origin
git config master.merge refs/heads/master

# revert local repo to a previous commit (can then push)
git revert --no-commit <commit_unique_token>..HEAD
git commit

git branch # check branches (*<current_branch>)

# create new branch, make changes, merge changes back to master
git checkout -b <branch_name> (create new branch, git checkout <branch_name> to switch branches)
git add .
git commit -m "updated branch"
git push (push changes to branch)
git checkout master (switch to master branch)
git merge <branch_name> (merge branch_name with master)
git push (push merged changes to master branch)
git branch -d <branch_name> (delete branch you've now finished with)

# resolving merge conflicts
files with merge conflicts will have conflicts highlighted as:

<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
 please contact us at support@github.com
</div>

git branch # check branches (*<current_branch>)
>>>>>>> iss53:index.html

where anything between <<<<<<<< HEAD and ======== is what was originally
in the file, and anything between ========= and >>>>>>>>>>> was what 
has since been added which is conflicting with the original. To resolve,
delete the highlight notation (i.e. delete <<<<<< HEAD, ====== etc) AND
either the original content or the new content so that only one is remaining,
then push.

# commited large file >100 MB GitHub limit
git fsck (find where dangling blob is)
git gc (do garbage collection) -> should now have <file_name> of file(s) taking up too much sapce in commit history
git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'rm -f <file_name>' HEAD (remove <file_name> from all commit histories)
git push origin --force (push updated commit histories with large file(s) now removed)

# move new files into e.g. docs/ dir at root of project, and in conf.py uncomment following to tell where proj root is

# set sphinx master doc for readthedocs to find in conf.py (otherwise get contents.rst not found)

# in <module_root>/docs, execute
make html

# build & overwrite docstring formatting
cd <module_root>/docs

# build auto-updating sphinx local website
cd <module_root>/docs

# to host on readthedocs, need a .readthedocs.yml in project root dir. This will instruct readthedocs e.g. which packages to install when building documentation. See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for example

# to generate pdf form, see: https://gist.github.com/alfredodeza/7fb5c667addb1c6963b9
# N.B. source -> directory where conf.py is, build/pdf -> where you want pdf to be generated
e.g. sphinx-build -b pdf docs/ docs/_build/pdf
